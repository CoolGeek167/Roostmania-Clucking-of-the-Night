# Roostmania-Clucking-of-the-Night
A Castlevania Fan Game for a school project. yay!

This is for my final project for my CSC 1350 class.
I dunno what else to say...once I've finished making the project, I'll provide binaries for Windows and macOS.

If you're done reading this, what are you waiting for...go and play the game already!
